- **Language Support**: Responses available in English, Hindi, and Kannada
- **Context Awareness**: Maintains healthcare focus even in casual conversation

### 3. Fallback Responses
When users input text that doesn't match any conversational patterns or medical symptoms, the chatbot provides helpful fallback responses that:
- Guide users toward health-related topics
- Explain the bot's capabilities
- Encourage symptom description

### 4. Enhanced User Experience
- **Friendly Interaction**: The chatbot now feels more like talking to a helpful healthcare assistant
- **Natural Flow**: Supports natural conversation patterns while maintaining medical expertise
- **Multi-language Support**: Conversational features work in all supported languages

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes (`app.py`)

1. **New Functions Added**:
   - `detect_conversational_pattern()`: Identifies conversational patterns in user input
   - `get_conversational_response()`: Generates appropriate responses for detected patterns
   - `get_fallback_response()`: Provides fallback responses for unrecognized input

2. **Enhanced Chat Endpoint**:
   - First checks for conversational patterns
   - Falls back to medical symptom analysis if no conversational pattern detected
   - Provides fallback responses for unrecognized input
   - Returns `is_conversational` flag to frontend

3. **Conversational Response Database**:
   - Structured responses for each pattern type
   - Multi-language support
   - Random selection for variety

### Frontend Changes (`templates/index.html`)

1. **Enhanced Message Handling**:
   - Detects `is_conversational` flag from backend
   - Displays conversational responses differently from medical advice
   - Maintains existing medical analysis display for symptom-based queries

## Usage Examples

### Conversational Flow
```
User: "hai"
Bot: "Hello! I'm your AI Healthcare Assistant. How can I help you today?"

User: "how are you"
Bot: "I'm doing great, thank you for asking! I'm here and ready to help with your health concerns. How are you feeling today?"

User: "what are you"
Bot: "I'm an AI Healthcare Assistant designed to help with medical queries and provide health guidance. I can analyze symptoms, suggest treatments, and offer medical advice. What would you like to know?"

User: "thank you"
Bot: "You're welcome! I'm glad I could help. Feel free to ask if you have more questions!"

User: "bye"
Bot: "Goodbye! Take care and stay healthy. Feel free to come back if you have any health concerns!"
```

### Medical Flow (Unchanged)
```
User: "I have a headache"
Bot: [Detailed medical analysis with symptoms, medications, precautions, etc.]
```

### Fallback Flow
```
User: "what is the weather"
Bot: "I'm here to help with your health concerns! Could you please describe any symptoms you're experiencing, or ask me about general health topics?"
```
